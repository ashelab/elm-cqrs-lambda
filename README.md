ELM-CQRS-LAMBDA
===============

> AWS Lambda Support for the ELM Runtime using CQRS

Getting Started
---------------

This library is built upon the shoulders of giants:

- [ELM](http://elm-lang.org/)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [Serverless](https://serverless.com/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)


Initialization and Response
-----

This library uses a combination of programWithFlags to allow initialization of the worker and a Ports subscription to provide the response.
